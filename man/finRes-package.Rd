\title{finRes: Data-science and research in finance and financial economics in R made easy}
\description{
finRes is a set of packages that work in harmony because they share common data 
  representations and 'API' design. It is meant to facilitate data-science and research in finance and 
  financial economics in R. This package is designed to make it easy to install and load multiple
  'finRes' packages in a single step.
